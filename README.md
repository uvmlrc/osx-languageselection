OSX Language Selection 
=====================

Small program to select environment language on login.

1. Compile program.
2. Put into your login items
3. Logout, logina, voilà.

Notes: 
This destroys your current array of langauges and replaces it with just the langauge you select and English. 
This kills the Dock and Finder automatically so that they load in the target language.
